# Introduction

Hello! We're project team E, and we're learning how to use Github by doing the tasks in the `issues` folder. We hope to become more familiar with Github by learning how to create issues, create project boards, edit `README.md` files, etc. Hopefully, we'll be able to *git* all the knowledge knowledge by the end of this! :joy:
